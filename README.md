# Jekyll::ViewSource

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-viewsource.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/jekyll-viewsource)

*Jekyll:ViewSource* is a plugin for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) that generates plain or pretty Markdown and HTML source code pages from your content.

## Installation

Add the gem to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
group :jekyll_plugins do
  # other plugins here
  gem 'jekyll-viewsource'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself:

    $ gem install jekyll-viewsource

## Configuration

No configuration is required to run *Jekyll::ViewSource*. If you want to tweak its behavior, you may set the following options in `_config.yml`:

```yaml
viewsource:
  #enabled: false                    # Default: true
  debug: true                        # Show additional messages during run; default: false
  #collection: pages, "articles"     # Which collections to paginate; default: pages and posts
  collections:                       # Ditto, just a different way of writing it
    - pages                          # Quotes are optional if collection names are obviously strings
    - posts
    - articles
  options: pretty                    # Options that normally go in a doc's front matter
```

## Usage

Just add a `viewsource: true` entry to the front-matter of the content for you want to create source files:

### Plain Markdown

```yaml
---
viewsource: true
---
```

(or `viewsource: md` or `viewsource: markdown`)

### Plain HTML

```yaml
viewsource: html
```

### Plain Markdown and HTML

```yaml
viewsource: markdown, html
```

### Prettified

Add <code>pretty[="<rouge_template|css_path>"]</code>, e.g.

```yaml
viewsource: markdown, html, pretty
```

```yaml
viewsource: markdown, html, pretty="thankful_eyes"
```

```yaml
viewsource: markdown, html, pretty="/url/path/to/syntax.css"
```

You may show the themes currently supported by Rouge via the command line:

    $ rougify help style
